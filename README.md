# sparkleIntegration
SparkleIntegration is a macOS application that demonstrates software update management using the [Sparkle framework](https://sparkle-project.org). Sparkle is an open-source framework easy to integrate and pretty secure as well.

To make the app update work an EdDSA key needs to be generated from the machine and it has to be mentioned in the info.plist. Read my [medium blog](https://medium.com/@arulmurugan_s/handle-software-updates-in-the-mac-app-using-sparkle-framework-646fdb2ed067) that explains the integration.

Thanks!
